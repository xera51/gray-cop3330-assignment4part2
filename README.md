Notes
<p>I added PopUps to warn users if they had yet to save a change. This ended up creating buggy behaviour, and after failing to figure out a fix,
  I attempted to rollback the directory, but was unsuccesful. Opening a list when another list is already open causes undefined behaviour</p>
<p> Help is located in Help->Getting Started</p>
